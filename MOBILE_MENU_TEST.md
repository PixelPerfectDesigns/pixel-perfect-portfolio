# Mobile Menu Implementation Test

## What Was Added

### React State Management
- Added `'use client'` directive to enable client-side functionality
- Imported `useState` from React
- Created `isMobileMenuOpen` state to track menu visibility
- Added `toggleMobileMenu` function to handle menu state

### Mobile Menu Button
- Animated hamburger icon that transforms when clicked
- Three horizontal lines that animate into an X when opened
- Gradient styling to match the brand colors
- Hidden on desktop, visible only on mobile (768px and below)

### Mobile Navigation Menu
- Slides down from the header when hamburger is clicked
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop blur
- Each menu item closes the menu when clicked
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Hidden on desktop, shown only on mobile

### Responsive CSS
- Added media queries for mobile breakpoints
- Hide desktop nav on mobile, show mobile nav
- Responsive typography scaling
- Mobile-specific button and text sizing

## How to Test

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. Open the browser to localhost:3000
3. Resize browser window to mobile width (768px or less) OR use browser dev tools mobile view
4. Click the hamburger menu button (3 horizontal lines)
5. Watch the menu slide down with smooth animation
6. Click any menu item to see it close automatically
7. Click the hamburger again (now an X) to close the menu

## React Functionality Demonstrated

This mobile menu showcases several key React concepts:
- **State Management**: Using useState to track menu open/close state
- **Event Handling**: onClick handlers for menu toggle and navigation
- **Conditional Rendering**: Different styles based on state
- **Component Interactivity**: Real-time UI updates based on user interaction
- **Responsive Design**: CSS-in-JS with dynamic styling

This is a perfect example of when React is essential - the interactive state management and real-time UI updates would be much more complex with vanilla JavaScript.
